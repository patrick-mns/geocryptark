This repository contains a TypeScript + Node.js implementation of **Geocryptark**, a proof-of-concept to validate and demonstrate the ideas proposed in the paper.

It showcases a decentralized cryptographic mechanism where access to data is tied to geographic coordinates and a common password â€” enabling location-based encryption without relying on trusted third parties.
